                    <p class="parafont1">Once in a while exchange of contact or connecting with someone, might not seem like an issue, but in case of social gatherings meant for networking where people meet new people, the number of social media choices can cause decision  lag, distraction and hassle.

                     <p class="parafont1">We started with competitive analysis and studied the existing platforms and how they make the exchange of contact information easier. Although these apps catered only to their services, the study helped us <b>understand their approach</b> and <b>identify problems</b> and <b>opportunities</b>. We also studied apps which tried to cater to all the platforms together and emphasized on easier exchange. Most applications of this kind were business card focused and lacked any user centered approach in their solution.</p>

                    <p class="parafont1">Our team sat together and we decided to brainstorm ideas at this stage without thinking about feasibility. The biggest hurdle for the other team members was not thinking about solution and concentrating on the problem and let the research inform the solution. We were successful in coming up with three approaches and showed them with the help of user journey for comparison.</p>

                      <p class="parafont1">Now the next step was to choose between these three concepts and drill down the features, technological limitations and concerns. We then evaluated all these idea against our design implications from the last session, and do's and don'ts. We decided to implement the discoverability idea which wasn't very different from QR though the way of interactions and accomplishing the task differed. </p>

                    <p class="parafont1">We had following goals when we set out to get user feedback.<br><br></p>

                     <p class="parafont1">General emotional response to the solution<br>
Are people comfortable with this method of sharing contact information?<br>
Does this solution <strong>reduce the time and cognitive load ?</strong><br>
What are the possible <strong>gaps</strong> between <strong>our design and user’s mental model</strong>?<br>
</p>




                       <p class="parafont1">Some users had concern with the privacy and they wanted to know if they can disconnect the app from their social media. We found that users struggled with understanding the flow first and they did not know what new connect meant. Discoverability button was confusing, and did not convey connecting or sharing contact information. We came up with following refined goals for the next round of iteration.</p>

                    


                        <br><br><br><br>
                      
                      <p class="subtitlefont">Hi-fi Prototype</p>
                      <p class="parafont1">For the first iteration I focused on designing the core features and flows of the application so that we could test if the design is simplifying the process or not. I used Adobe XD to make make the hi-fidelity prototype.</p>
                      <br><br>


                        <p class="parafont1">For near by discoverability, I made two designs each of them encouraging users to deactivate the discovery as soon they are done sharing and connecting. For the hi-fidelity testing, the idea was to test which animation made sense and went well in conveying the function. following are the two designs that I came up with. User will turn on the discovery which will generate a 4 digit code. The other person will just type in the code to receive contact</p>

                     <p class="parafont1">I and Kenneth conducted cognitive walk-through with 8 users with different goals of networking. We introduced our goal and the concept, and described the activity to help them ease up. We then described the scenario, and let users use the app. while thinking aloud. As they completed every task we asked them to reflect back on the task and fill up a questionnaire.

                     <p class="subtitlefont">Feedback & Design Interaction</p>
                       <p class="parafont1">We conducted cognitive walk-through to test our first iteration of the hi-fidelity prototype and found that
                      <br><br> users thought they had to click on yellow notification to activate discovery. The notification feature wasn't clear,
                      <br><br> users wanted to be able to choose the social media platform they wanted to share,
                      <br> <br>some users found the profile interface overwhelming.
                      <br><br><br><br>
                    <p class="subtitlefont">Final Prototype</p>

                     <p class="parafont1">We made changes in visual design and some of the flows addressing the concerns and evidences from the user testing. The final prototype shows nearby users who can readily share their information.</p>

                     <p class="subtitlefont">Lessons Learned</p>

                      <p class="parafont1">Storyboarding any journey either existing situation or the solution can bring up very important subtle issues that one might not imagine. In this project we drew a lot of stories for different settings and contexts to help the team empathize with different user persona. The story boarding was also necessary to have the entire team on the same page especially when we had 3 developers and two designers. <br> <br> We also realized that an easy and efficient task is not necessarily the one that takes less time it is also about cognitive load. Even if we do not reduce the time taken in exchange of contact drastically, reducing the inertia and uneasiness and a feeling of smooth completion of task matters.</p>
