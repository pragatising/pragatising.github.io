                        <p class="parafont1">How can we help people swap contact with each other during business events, networking events and social gatherings faster and easily?</p>


                        <br>

                        <h2 class="subtitlefont">Our Solution</h2>



                        <p class="parafont1">We came up with bluetooth based wireless sharing of contact in a way that for users the solution seemed seamless and users could connect with people/exchange contact information much faster without hassle. Our solution included three features, namely, a profile section with all the contact information, allowing discovery to let others view ones profile, and accessing someone's profile to save their contact in the form of cards</p>

                        <p class="subtitlefont">Hypothesis</p>
                        <p class="parafont1">Once in a while exchange of contact or connecting with someone, might not seem like an issue, but in case of social gatherings meant for networking where people meet new people, the number of social media choices can cause decision lag, distraction and hassle. We conducted primary and secondary research to test our hypothesis before setting out to design.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p class="parafont1">How might we improve the experience of sharing contact information between two people during casual and professional meet-ups?</p>

                        <p class="parafont1">We started with competitive analysis and studied the existing platforms and how they make the exchange of contact information easier. Although these apps catered only to their services, the study helped us <b>understand their approach</b> and <b>identify problems</b> and <b>opportunities</b>. We also studied apps which tried to cater to all the platforms together and emphasized on easier exchange. Most applications of this kind were business card focused and lacked any user centered approach in their solution.</p>

                        <p class="parafont1">I and Kenneth conducted cognitive walk-through with 8 users with different goals of networking. We introduced our goal and the concept, and described the activity to help them ease up. We then described the scenario, and let users use the app. while thinking aloud. As they completed every task we asked them to reflect back on the task and fill up a questionnaire.

                            <li>users thought they had to click on yellow notification to activate discovery. The notification feature wasn't clear,</li>
                            <li>users wanted to be able to choose the social media platform they wanted to share,
                            </li>
                            <li>3 users found the profile interface overwhelming.</li>
                            <li>4 of the 6 users had difficulty understanding they can edit what they share on the go.</li>
                            <li>2 users used the word 'complicated' for the solution </li>

                        <p class="parafont1">We made changes in visual design and some of the flows addressing the concerns and evidences from the user testing. The final prototype shows nearby users who can readily share their information.</p>

                        <p class="subtitlefont">Lessons Learned</p>

                        <p class="parafont1">Storyboarding any journey either existing situation or the solution can bring up very important subtle issues that one might not imagine. In this project we drew a lot of stories for different settings and contexts to help the team empathize with different user persona. The story boarding was also necessary to have the entire team on the same page especially when we had 3 developers and two designers. <br> <br> We also realized that an easy and efficient task is not necessarily the one that takes less time it is also about cognitive load. Even if we do not reduce the time taken in exchange of contact drastically, reducing the inertia and uneasiness and a feeling of smooth completion of task matters.</p>
