                    <p class="parafont1">Once in a while exchange of contact or connecting with someone, might not seem like an issue, but in case of social gatherings meant for networking where people meet new people, the number of social media choices can cause decision  lag, distraction and hassle. We conducted primary and secondary research to test our hypothesis before setting out to design.</p>

                     <p class="parafont1">We started with competitive analysis and studied the existing platforms and how they make the exchange of contact information easier. Although these apps catered only to their services, the study help us understand their approach and identify problems and oppprotunities. We also studied apps which tried to cater to all the platforms together and emphaised on easier exchange. Most applicatons of this kind ere business card focused and lacked any user centered apparoach in their solution.</p>

Are people comfortable with this method of sharing contact information?<br>
Does this solution <strong>reduce the time and cognitive load ?</strong><br>
What are the possible <strong>gaps</strong> between <strong>our design and user’s mental model</strong>?<br>
</p>




                       <p class="parafont1">Some users had concern with the privacy and they wanted to know if they can disconnect the app from their social media. We found that users struggled with understanding the flow first and they did not know what new connect meant. Dsicoverability button was confusing, and did not convey conneting or sharing conatct information. We came up with following refined goals for the next round of iteration.</p>

                     <p class="parafont1">I and Kenneth conducted cognitive walkthrough with 8 users with different goals of networking. We introduced our goal and the concept, and described the activity to help them ease up. We then described the scenario, and let users use the app. while thinking aloud. As they completed every task we asked them to reflect back on the task and fill up a questionnaire.

                      <br><br> users wanted to be able to choose the social media platform they wanted to share,

                      <p class="parafont1">Storyboarding any journey either existing situation or the solution can bring up very important subtle issues that one might not imagine. In this project we drew a lot of stories for different settings and contexts to help the team empathise with different user personas. The story boarding was also necessary to have the entire team on the same page especially when we had 3 developers and two deisgners.</p>
