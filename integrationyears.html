Especially when we are telling someone elseâ€™s story, even though our role is limited to creating the experience and not the content, as a designer we do get to decide how that story will be told. In this regard, apart from historical study about Lester Maddox, Integration Years, Civil Rights Movement etc, I also studied Dr. Nassim Parvin's essay on Doing Justice to Digital Storytelling. </p>

                    <p class="parafont1">While discussing various topics with the client, I found that the topics were nothing but places in the county. And in the context of the county itself, the term "topic" seemed diminutive. Hence we decided to rename "topics" to "places". This also gave a better sense of history for the county- "People", "Places" and "Historical Timeline". The term Gallery also seemed devoid of emotion and turned history into an object, hence, it was chanegd to "In Pictures". To arrive at these design decisions, I conducted a critique session with 3 Digital Media Scholars and Researchers. The mid-fidelity variations were used to brainstorm ideas and also sturcture the content and the stories.</p>

                    <p class="parafont1">Thinking about interface design, the current design gives a lot of visual space for the audience to wander away and not be fully immersed. By visual space, I mean the empty white space that we have right now which leans more towards an archive rather storytelling. Although it was for the first roll out, rethinking through it, a good starting point would be to begin from the emotions we want to evoke, for digital storytelling. <br><br>As all of this comes with a risk of trying to re-inventing the wheel, to avoid late realisations, I learned that it is very important to have a framework grounded in the theoretical understanding of digital humanities and storytelling. Maybe we need more art than the design or think of ourselves, not as designers but artists whose canvas is an electronic screen and a keyboard, maybe we need to change our vocabulary to enable us to think beyond human-computer-interaction, where the medium doesn't become bigger than the message. More than anything, these are the thoughts that need to be carefully evaluated and understood before we jump into making and doing.</p>
